# A simplified Jira clone built with Angular 9 and Akita

> Phase 2 will start off very soon with several promisingly exciting features: GraphQL, Authentication, and more.

There have been a handful of cool Jira-cloned apps written in `React`/`VueJS`, which makes me wonder **Why not Angular**? And here you go.

This is not only a simplified Jira clone built with Angular 9, but also an example of a **modern**, **real-world** Angular codebase.

## Working application

## Who is it for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I have been working with Angular for about four years. I built cool stuff at [Zyllem][zyllem] but almost all of them are internal apps which is difficult to show.

This is a showcase application I've built in my spare time to experiment the new library that I wanted to try before: `Akita`, `TailwindCSS`, `ng-zorro`.

There are many Angular examples on the web but most of them are way too simple. I like to think that this codebase contains enough complexity to offer valuable insights to **Angular developers of all skill levels** while still being _relatively_ easy to understand.

This piece of work is also part of our technical series [angular-vietnam/100-days-of-angular][100days] which aims at enabling everyone, after 100 days of learning Angular with us, to **self-build their application with the similar scale**. Our desire is to advocate and grow the Angular developer community in Vietnam.

## Features and Roadmap

I set the tentative deadline for motivating myself to finish the work on time. Otherwise, It will take forever to complete :)

### Phase 1 - Angular application and simple Nest API

> June 13 - 27, 2020

- [x] Proven, scalable, and easy to understand project structure
- [x] Simple drag and drop kanban board
- [x] Add/update issue
- [x] Search/filtering issues
- [x] Add comments

> Noted: All of your interactions with data such as leave a comment or change the issue detail will not be saved to the persistent database. Currently, the application will serve a fixed structure of data every time you open the app. It means if you reload the browser, all of your changes will be gone.
>
> Phase 2 will bring you a proper API where you can log in and save your work.

While working with this application, I have the opportunity to revisit some of the interesting topics:

- TailwindCSS configuration - that's awesome
- Scrollable layout with Flexbox
- Deploy Angular application to Netlify

I will take two weeks break to:

- Fix bugs and UI enhancements for Angular Jira clone.
- Continue working with the [typescript-data-structures][typescript-dsa] repo.

[typescript-dsa]: https://github.com/trungk18/typescript-data-structures

### Phase 2

> July 10 - 25, 2020

- [ ] Refactor the mono repo to use Nx Workspace
- [ ] GraphQL API and store data on the actual database
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Websocket realtime update
- [ ] Interactive report

## Tutorial

When I look at the application, it is huge. When the task is huge, you usually don't know where and how to start working with them. I started to break the big task into a [simple to-do list on notion][todo-list]. Once I know what needs to be done, what I need is to follow the plan. That's my approach.

I learned a lot of stuff. I know you might also have a curiosity about the process of building the same scale app as well. That's why I am writing a tutorial series on how I built Angular Jira clone from scratch. I hope you guys will learn something from that too :)

I will try to be as detailed as possible. Hopefully through the tutorial, you will get the idea and will start working on your own application soon. Please bear with me.

Its series will also be published in Vietnamese as part of our [angular-vietnam/100-days-of-angular][100days].

## Time spending

It is a side project that I only spent time outside of the office hours to work on. One day, my team and I were fire fighting on PROD until 11 PM. After taking a shower, I continue with Angular Jira clone for another two hours...

According to waka time report, I have spent about 45 hours working on this project. Which is equivalent to watch the [whole Stranger Things series twice][stranger].

I really enjoyed working on this project. The interactive kanban board took me sometimes, it is challenging but exciting at the same time.

## What's currently missing?

There are missing features from the live demo which should exist in a real product. All of them will be finished on Phase 2:

### Proper backend API

I built a very simple NestJS API to send a fixed data structure to the client. All of your interactivity with data will only be saved on the memory. If you refresh the page, it will be gone. Phase 2 will bring the application to live by saving the data into a database.

### Proper authentication system üîê

I am currently sending the same email and a random password to the server without any check to get the current user back. Phase 2 will also bring a proper authentication system.

### Accessibility ‚ôø

Not all components have properly defined [aria attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), visual focus indicators, etc.

## Setting up development environment üõ†

- `git clone https://github.com/trungk18/jira-clone-angular.git`
- `cd jira-clone-angular`
- `npm run start:back` for the API
- The API server should run on `http://localhost:3000`
- `npm run start:front` for angular web application
- The app should run on `http://localhost:4200/`

### Unit/Integration tests üß™

I skipped writing test for this project. I might do it for the proper backend GraphQL API.

## Compatibility

It was being tested on IE 11, Chrome and Firefox. For Safari, there are some minor alignment issues.
